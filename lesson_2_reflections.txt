What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When i create a new repository .git folder is created in it which contains the mata deta about the repository. At initial state all files are untract so i need to use git add command followed by file name to start tracking it 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
May staging area allows us to add commits of files but they are not store as master file
